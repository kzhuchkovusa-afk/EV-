                    </p>

                    <h2>5. Pricing and Payment Terms</h2>

                        Our standard payment structure is as follows:
                    </p>

                        In accordance with Florida Statutes Chapter 713, failure to make payment may result in 
                        the filing of a construction lien against your property. You will receive all required 
                        lien law notices as mandated by Florida law.

                        We warrant that all work will be performed in a professional manner in accordance with 
                        industry standards. We provide a <strong>one-year warranty</strong> on workmanship for 
                        defects in application or materials, subject to the following conditions:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Normal wear and tear is not covered</li>
                        <li>Warranty is void if paint is damaged by Client or third parties</li>

                    </ul>

                    <h3>7.2 Materials Warranty</h3>
                    <p>
                        Paint and materials are covered by the manufacturer's warranty. We use premium brands 
                        (Sherwin-Williams, Benjamin Moore) that typically provide multi-year product warranties. 
                        Manufacturer warranty claims must be processed directly with the manufacturer.
                    </p>

                    <h3>7.3 Free One-Year Inspection</h3>
                    <p>
                        As a bonus, we provide one free inspection and service visit within the first year after 
                        project completion to ensure your satisfaction and address any concerns.
                    </p>

                    <h3>7.4 Warranty Claims</h3>
                    <p>
                        To make a warranty claim, contact us in writing within the warranty period. We will 
                        inspect the issue and, if covered under warranty, repair or repaint the affected area 
                        at no charge.
                    </p>

                    <h3>8.3 Weather-Related Delays</h3>
                    <p>
                        Given Miami's climate, painting work may be delayed due to rain, high humidity, or 
                        extreme heat that affects paint application and curing. Such delays do not constitute 
                        breach of contract.
